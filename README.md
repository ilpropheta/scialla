scialla
=======
This is a library where I collect and organize my utilities and common functions/classes/idioms.

## More information

I'll write more details asap. If something is particularly interesting I'd like to blog about it.
I'll try to show examples and real cases, because this library is inspired by real world code and needs.

## Why "scialla"? 
Don't bother to find an acronym of "scialla". This is slang from Rome - actually it's a pretty much new word, rather than a traditional Roman word.
It basically means "relax", "don't worry". So is the scope of this library.
